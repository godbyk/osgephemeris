From Richard Baron Penman, contributor of the VC9 build:

In case anyone is interested these are the steps I took to compile on Windows:
- header files in project file were missing .h extension
- needed to define OSGEPHEMERIS_LIBRARY_STATIC to prevent dll linkage errors
- removed /win32 suffix from lib directories
- changed OpenThreadsWin32.lib -> OpenThreads.lib
- changed osgProducer -> osgViewer
- set environment variables $(OPENTHREADS_ROOT) and $(OSG_ROOT) and removed $(PRODUCER_ROOT)
